# LowPowerSensorStationDatalogger

Project done in 4th year of Masters passed in Poland.

# Description

This project is based on an ATmega328 processor and the goal is to last the most time possible with a 3.3V battery.
The component of storing and analyzing the data is just to check we can have a proper function of the processor even when it spends the most part of the time sleeping.

# Objectives

The main objectives of this project are the Low Power Mode, Data log (save to a SD card values of temp., humidity, light, etc.) and a Matlab Interactive Interface to read and analyze the data.
It must last a reasonable time with the battery, store correctly the values and have a proper analysis program.
